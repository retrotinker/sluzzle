This repository contains code related to my "Stupid VDG Tricks" blog:

	http://vdgtricks.blogspot.com/

At present, it contains code to convert still images to a format
displayable on a CoCo in SG24 mode, 8-color G6C mode, and the 44-color
"flicker" mode created when combining the previous two modes at
runtime.

This is a project to accompany a blog.	Don't expect "user friendly"
results, at least not anytime soon.  If you can't program in C or
6809 assembly, or if you aren't comfortable looking at a Makefile,
or if you aren't using Linux or some other Unix-centric environment,
then you will have trouble taking any value from this project.	I'm not
hostile to anyone that doesn't meet the above list, I'm just not ready
for you.  Patches are welcome, if you want to improve the project.

As-is, if you have a C compiler and mamou in your PATH then all
you need to do is run "make".  The objects are located to execute
from $1e00.  To change the picture, copy whatever picture you want
to use over to the name test.jpg and re-run "make".  Currently I
am producing S-record files for use in my MON09-based development
environment.  The assembly stuff may need to be relocated in order
to be loaded from DECB or whatever.  Let me know, and I'll work with
you to resolve issues like that.

Well...enough for now!
